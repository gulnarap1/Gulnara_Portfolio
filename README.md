#Asthma severity Index: Project Overview
1. Designed and built machine learning models to predict asthma severity index by aggregating data from EPA, IQVIA and WTI sources, analyzing 50 years of time series data using Python and Azure to estimate demand for asthma related products
2. Optimized models with VIF, feature selection method using Python and decreased error rate by 21%
3. Presented results, insights and recommendations with Tableau dashboards to senior management to reveal that air pollution and weather impact asthma severity index and severity level can be predicted and thus the outcome can be used by WTI to predict sales for pharmaceuticals to manage with demand and inventory and optimize their overall sales operations
